        Hi I'm Dan! I graduated from UCLA 2013 with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering.
        Feeling like I needed a break from the intense academic hell I was put through,
        I decided to test my mettle as a project manager for a vitamin import/export company.

        After a couple of years of that, I started to miss math again. Call it and itch, call it
        Stockholm Syndrome, I eventually decide to quit my old job and pursue a career in Tech again.
        I thought about going straight back where I left off and do Electrical Engineering but
        thinking about it, coding was always fun to me back in college and I figured it could fulfill
        my brain's math craving while and not toss me into a dingy lab environment. So~ long story short,
        I'm here.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also like cooking and doodling. You can also ask me about that if you'd like.
